# MAD-Level01_Task02
Task 2 of the first level assignment in "Mobile Application Development" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Computer Science, 5th semester).

## Task
We need to make an app in which the knowledge of the user for the truth table of conjunction is tested. It should be a quiz in which the user is only allowed to fill in "T" or "F" (true or false). When all input fields are filled in, the user should click on the submit button to see how many answers are correct. This should be done with a Toast message. The user can try again until all the answers are correct. The layout file should be built with a ConstraintLayout. If not all the field are filled in the user should get a message about this.
